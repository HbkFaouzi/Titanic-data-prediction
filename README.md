# Titanic-data-prediction
This project is an analysis of the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on board the Titanic when it sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.

## 1. Libraries 
The analyse was conducted using python and the following libaries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## 2. Analysis Questions
* How many passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic? What percentage of passengers survived?
* What was the distribution of passenger ages? Was there a significant difference in the average age of male and female passengers?
* What was the distribution of passenger classes? Was there a significant difference in the survival rate of passengers in different classes?
* Were passengers traveling alone more likely to survive than those traveling with family members?
* Did the port of embarkation have an impact on the survival rate of passengers?

## 3. Results

* 342 passengers (38.38%) survived the Titanic's sinking.
* The passenger age distribution was very standard, with a mean age of 29.7 years. The average age of male and female passengers did not differ much.
* The largest of passengers (55.11%) traveled in third class, followed by first class (24.24%), and second class (20.65%). Passengers in first class had a better chance of survival than those in second or third class.
* Travelers traveling alone had a worse chance of survival than those going with family members.
* The port of embarkation did have an effect on passenger survivability, with those departing from Cherbourg being more likely to survive than those departing from the other ports.
